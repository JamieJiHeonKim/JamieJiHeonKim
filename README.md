Hi, I'm Ji Heon Kim
Full‑stack engineer • Product architect • AI‑driven builder

I’ve spent the past 4+ years designing and shipping scalable web and mobile applications, automation systems, and AI‑powered tools that genuinely make people’s lives easier.
My work blends technical depth, product intuition, and a belief that software should remove friction — not add to it.

I’m currently exploring:

AI‑powered workflows & LLM integrations

High‑impact web/mobile apps

Community‑driven problem marketplaces

Fast, scalable, pragmatic engineering patterns

Frontend: React, Next.js, React Native, Tailwind, Expo
Backend: Node.js, Express, FastAPI, Django, REST
Infra: Docker, AWS, Vercel, Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
